              <p>Waking Up at 4:30 AM, Are you kidding me? oh...No~~ Then, Are you going to watching the sun rise??? uhmmm... Not really, but you could say I'm going to watching my future rise up. Most of people  wants to see something different, and waking up so early is definitely an abnormal thing, but if you don't do these kind of abnormal things how can possible see somehting different? If you want to change something in your shit life, you gotta do it consistentily. Don't worry it won't makes you weak or tired in whole day. In my case, this routing makes me stronger and got more time to use.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>In the first few days, people were really concerned about their heath, worried a lot, but I have to tell you that the first thing you gotta remove from your brain completely. Your brain was designed to protect yourself, so these sort of phenomenons was understandable totally.  Let's conquer it step by step.</p>
<p>How to get used to get up at 4:30 AM progressively. If you get up at 7:30 AM usually, set the alarm to 6:30 AM in the first week, once the alarm rings, you get out of bed instantly, don't ever press snooze button. The snooze button was the stupidest function that human ever made. What benefit  you could get from snooze? If you hit the snooze button you will getting more sleeping in whole day definitely. If you want to wake up at a certain time, please don't delay it for any minute, don't be procrastination. Go to bed before 23 o'clock, keep wake up at 6:30 for 1~2 weeks consistentily, you will make it happen. next step, adjust one more hour early alarm which set alarm to 5:30 AM, go to bed before 22 o'clock. Similary, keep that routine 1~2 weeks. Finally, adjust the alarm to 4:30 AM, see, it's pretty easy right? Its easy to say, hard to make, but you always want to see something different don't you? That's the sacrifices you need to make.</p>
<p>One the most important reason that you can't get up at 4:30 AM which your brain activity was low. Find something to learn to study to work for. Here's my path:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are so many books waiting for me to read.</li>
<li>English learning, that's my big goal has to achieve.</li>
<li>Watch motivational speech will give me more energy.</li>
<li>Go to the gym 3~5 times peer week keeps me heathy.</li>
<li>Do work stufff ASAP, and finish more job every day.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm a pretty average people, if it works for me, then it also works for you by 99% chance.</p>
