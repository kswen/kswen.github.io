              <p>Aha... to speak about elements which coming from your mind is something like chemical element just like the picture above demonstrates. Here, I try to talk about something diff from elements. The first one is Computer science, and the second element is English, I mean the English language, Why? Because my native language is not English, It is my second language. To the people who seem in my shoes,  I recommend that you have to learn English well..üòç</p>

<h2 id="the-computer-science">The Computer science</h2>
<p>Why? I am a software programmer, of course, it's not the only reason, The truth is that no matter what we, the computer is part of the elements we live in, especial for the people birth after 21sth century, and I have been suffered from daily life work activity with computer-related kinds of stuff. Such as I need to help people to install the OS, or install some office software, etc. and it's not even part of my job, which cost a lot of my time. Why you can't complete so easy job with the computer? why so stupid even can't set up the router properly although Manufacturing factory already did so many automatic setting navigators. Why don't understand Virus and Software installation? Why the fucking thing's so simple but you still look like a dumb asshole just steering at it?  these fundamental life skills always drive me crazy. So in my reflection think times, I summarized two main reasons why they lack these computer skills.</p>
<h3 id="the-computer-science-course-engaged-too-late">The computer science course engaged too late</h3>
<p>Alright, allow me to introduce this truth from my personal story.<br>
I was born 1987 and from a pretty normal peasant farmers family. My first time to get in touch(not exactly touch, in fact, we just saw it out there in the teacher's desktop) with the computer was in Aug. 2000, which was in middle school, The 3.5 inches floppy disk was the Computer science expression in that age. There was only one computer in the whole middle school, we could learn some basic conceptions from the computer course.  No practical course, everything was in theory. After 2 years we got more computers, and even we could get involved with command practice every student. That was super exciting moments in a computer course, everyone was expected computer course.  What're the main skills that we try to learn was how to type words.<br>
in high school, we were able to use computer to chat with others through QQ or some other chat software, that society chat was damn crazy, make friends, love relationship, build website, build blog, Wow...the most fascination things was to go surfing on the internet after bedded lights off and craw over the wall to Internet bar...</p>
<p>So, in the computer course, we did not get many experiences with computer science. Actually, already forgot that weather we have computer science course in high school or not. üòÇ Thanks to the Internet bars on the street for what my decision had been made base one some advertisement that shows in the screen which said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The software engineer will be the hottest job position in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ok, I believe that immediately when I saw it in the first place. Nowadays, it seems quite right, many more people joined this development army.  I spent 3 years to study computer software stuff, actually, it's really difficult for me to understand most of the theory, programming language, database language... it's so complicated to me. My computer foundation was too weak, so I have studied harder than others, today I know something about it and more importantly, was that I found some way to learn computer science will. Also came out of this idea, computer science is pretty important not only for our generation but to the next generation.</p>
<p>I strongly suggest that the Education System has to make computer science as a top priority class course to study no matter which levels classes, it has to be incepts into the Education System properly. You wanna prosper life go learn computer science will...</p>
<h3 id="besides-what-i-said-we-also-have-many-more-official-reasons">Besides what I said, we also have many more official reasons</h3>
<p>The Association of Computing Machinery is an international organization for computer scientists. The ACM has developed the following list of top ten reasons to study computer science which we quote:</p>

<p><em>The above was TOP TEN REASONS TO STUDY COMPUTER SCIENCE</em></p>
<h2 id="the-english-language">The English Language</h2>
<p>Why? about this point, hahahhaa... everyone can tell it easily, look at this article, like a piece of shit, grammar issues, spelling bugs and breaches everywhere.</p>
<p>The most critical and obviously was taken the first element as a reference, almost every program or software whatever you call are programmed in English, by guesses 99% of the existing programs.</p>
<h2 id="btw">BTW</h2>
<p>At the begin I just want to write this article as a draft and fix spelling issues later, but it's getting longer and longer, then suddenly I only want to leave with what it is, why not learn from the future instead of to fix the history, be a lifelong learner not just a fixer.</p>
